## Just a list of my favorite things...

It's nice to learn about things that make your life easier, right? So here's some things that I love that could make your life a little better.

### *IDE Plugins*
My IDE of choice is [Atom](https://atom.io) - not only because it's stylish, but it's so easy to customize!

### *Note Taking*
![image-left](../images/favorites/quiver.png){: .align-left} [Quiver](http://happenapps.com/#quiver) is a great notebook for programmers. It's the first notebook app that I've seen that has the best support for code note taking. It supports over 120 languages. There's even a presentation mode, so there's little effort need to be made if you need to do an importu talk. Files are saved as JSON and can be saved locally or on a cloud platform.

The only downside is that it's only for Macs. If you have a Mac, go ahead and download a [free trial](http://happenapps.com/#quiver)!
